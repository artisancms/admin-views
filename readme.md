# A port of AdminLTE to Laravel for use with ArtisanCMS

This is still early stage as of, 08/31/2016. Basically, parts have been split into layouts and templates, but that's about it. Wanted to get it in Github, Packagist, and start installing with install, and see what adjustments need to be made in order to make it dev friendly to use with ArtisanCMS.
